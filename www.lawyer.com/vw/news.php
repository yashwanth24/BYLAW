But this is 2018 Lindsay, and she’s here with a beyond-fitting endorsement deal from a website that promises to find a lawyer to take care of all of life’s speed bumps (like a DUI or two or 40), and she is here to WERK by offering Donald Trump the Lawyer.com team of legal professionals!

Now, through a new sponsorship with the very directly named Lawyer.com, the shoe is on the other foot. At long last, the legal fees are moving in the other direction.

                                   Lindsay Lohan has a new — and unexpected — gig as the new spokeswoman for Lawyer.com, a data base of sorts for all your legal service needs. According to the site, the movie star/makeup mogul will spend the next year promoting the site across her social platforms through campaigns and fun (well, as fun as legal-related content can be) videos. Additionally, she'll help brainstorm ways to improve outreach and the site's overall functionality.

But, in a truly genius move, Lawyer.com asked legendary troublemaker Lindsay Lohan to be their spokesperson, because who knows more about needing a lawyer than her?

The Mean Girls actress has dropped her strange accent and taken on the starring role as spokesperson for Lawyer.com—and its kind of genius.

On Wednesday, Lindsay Lohan trolled President Trump on Twitter, telling him that he should look for an attorney using the website she now represents, Lawyer.com.

                                   Lindsay Lohan is officially back on our screens — in her original accent, no less — but unfortunately, it’s not because she *finally* got Mean Girls 2 off the ground. In a very interesting twist of fate, the Life-Size actress is the new spokesperson for Lawyer.com — and honestly, we can’t decide if we should have seen this one coming. But it seems we’re not alone, as Lohan was just as surprised that Lawyer.com wanted her to be its spokesperson.
